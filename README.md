# Freestyle-Project

Please install Python 3.6 to use this application.
Also install the following add-ins:
-pandas
-pandas_datareader
-matplotlib
-yahoo-finance

You will also need to clone the repository from https://github.com/swanm89/Freestyle-Project

This app will pull daily stock prices from a starting date that the user inputs, from Yahoo finance, based off tickets from the CSV file 'Tickers' in the data repository. The stock prices will appear in the CMD shell, but also be sent to a new CSV file called 'Stock_prices'in the data repository. The user will also have the option to graph the prices.
